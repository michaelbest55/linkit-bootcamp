# Data Engineering traineeship assessment

The goal of this test is to asses yourself and open a path to a clear and concise technical interview.

Remember, you already went through our screening and first interview; this is the beginning and preparation for a mutual technical conversation.

We do not expect you to know any of these tools here. But all of them are widely used and have a large variety of information all over the internet, so it's not an extremely complex job. The traineeship will start with an intense bootcamp for 2 months and being able to find your way around the tools from day 0 is very important ability, thus this assessment.

## Hortonworks Data Platform Sandbox

Download the latest HDP sandbox and run locally following the instructions [here](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/learning-the-ropes-of-the-hortonworks-sandbox/) to learn how to setup and everything.
Do the first tutorial [Learning the Ropes of the HDP Sandbox](https://hortonworks.com/tutorial/learning-the-ropes-of-the-hortonworks-sandbox)

> This was tested running on a macbook with 16GB of RAM. Check your memory usage or deploy in the cloud if you need more. I recommend allocating at least 8GB for this `vbox`.

Explain you steps and impression in `MyExperience.md`.

## Scala + Spark

### Basic HDFS & Hive

Build a Scala application using Spark (you must use [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) as a build tool) and execute against the Sandbox Hive & SPark to do the following:
- upload the `.csv` files on <a href="data-spark/">`data-spark`</a> to HDFS
- create tables on Hive for each `.csv` file
- output a dataframe on Spark that contains `DRIVERID, NAME, HOURS_LOGGED, MILES_LOGGED` so you can have aggregated information about the driver.

Besides the code on a repo, explain you steps and impression in <a href="`MyExperience.md">`MyExperience.md`</a>.

### HBase

Extend the Scala application above so that it can: 
- create a table `dangerous_driving` on HBase
- load <a href="data-hbase/dangerous-driver.csv">`dangerous-driver.csv`</a>
- add a 4th element to the table from `extra-driver.csv`
- Update `id = 4` to display `routeName` as `Los Angeles to Santa Clara` instead of `Santa Clara to San Diego`
- Outputs to console the Name of the driver, the type of event and the event Time if the origin or destination is `Los Angeles`.

Same thing here, besides the code on a repo, explain you steps and impression in <a href="`MyExperience.md">`MyExperience.md`</a>.

## Show off and get extra-points
If you use Docker version of the HDP Sandbox and/or if you use Docker for your Scala application.

## Doubts &/Or Submission

Clone this repository to start working on your own prefered git tool. In the end, commit and push your solution and send us the link.
